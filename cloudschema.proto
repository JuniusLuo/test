// md5 is 32 bytes. if data block is 128KB, 128MB object has 1k blocks, 32KB.

// 1TB object has 8m bloks, 256MB. 4TB object has 32m blocks, 1GB.
// So we need the ability to split the blocks.
// 1. split meta object to multiple objects, such as /b1/k1.md.1, k1.md.2, etc.
//    needs to handle the object name actually exist. For example, k1.md is a real
//    object name. The meta object of k1.md will be k1.md.md.1.
// 2. keep a single meta object. The problem becomes how to deserialize.
//    we have to have a small meta gpb with fixed size. Then append the split blocks.
// 3. unify with MPU. We could split the blocks to parts. The first 64k blocks 2MB
//    will be stored directly in the meta object with other metadata.
//
// #3 is best.
//
// Just a reference: DD block size is variable and ends up being 4K-12K, another says 64KB?
